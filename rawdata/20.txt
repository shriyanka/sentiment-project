I’ve often shared the habits and techniques I use to handle stress in my life. But this week I’d like to do something different.

I’d like to share other people’s perspectives on stress. And what to do about it so that you can live a healthier, more focused and at the same time more relaxing life.

Here are 30 timeless thoughts on stress and how to handle it from the people who came before us (and some from people who are here with us now).

    “The time to relax is when you don’t have time for it.”
    – Sydney J. Harris
    “One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was from a horse master. He told me to go slow to go fast. I think that applies to everything in life. We live as though there aren’t enough hours in the day but if we do each thing calmly and carefully we will get it done quicker and with much less stress.”
    – Viggo Mortensen
    “Much of the stress that people feel doesn’t come from having too much to do. It comes from not finishing what they’ve started.”
    – David Allen
    “In times of great stress or adversity, it’s always best to keep busy, to plow your anger and your energy into something positive.”
    – Lee Iacocca
    “It is not a daily increase, but a daily decrease. Hack away at the inessentials.”
    – Bruce Lee
    “The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another.”
    – William James
    “We can easily manage if we will only take, each day, the burden appointed to it. But the load will be too heavy for us if we carry yesterday’s burden over again today, and then add the burden of the morrow before we are required to bear it.”
    – John Newton
    “It’s a good idea always to do something relaxing prior to making an important decision in your life.”
    – Paulo Coelho
    “Take rest; a field that has rested gives a bountiful crop.”
    – Ovid
    “Doing something that is productive is a great way to alleviate emotional stress. Get your mind doing something that is productive.”
    – Ziggy Marley
    “Stress is caused by being ‘here’ but wanting to be ‘there.’
    – Eckhart Tolle
    “The greatest mistake you can make in life is to be continually fearing you will make one.”
    – Elbert Hubbard
    “Its not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it.”
    – Hans Selye
    “There are thousands of causes for stress, and one antidote to stress is self-expression. That’s what happens to me every day. My thoughts get off my chest, down my sleeves and onto my pad.”
    – Garson Kanin
    “For fast-acting relief, try slowing down. “
    – Lily Tomlin
    “Somehow our devils are never quite what we expect when we meet them face to face.”
    – Nelson DeMille
    “A crust eaten in peace is better than a banquet partaken in anxiety. “
    – Aesop
    “If people concentrated on the really important things in life, there’d be a shortage of fishing poles.”
    – Doug Larson
    “If you treat every situation as a life and death matter, you’ll die a lot of times.”
    – Dean Smith
    “If you ask what is the single most important key to longevity, I would have to say it is avoiding worry, stress and tension. And if you didn’t ask me, I’d still have to say it.”
    – George Burns
    “Do not anticipate trouble or worry about what may never happen. Keep in the sunlight.”
    – Benjamin Franklin
    “How beautiful it is to do nothing, and then to rest afterward.”
    – Spanish proverb
    “In times of stress, the best thing we can do for each other is to listen with our ears and our hearts and to be assured that our questions are just as important as our answers.”
    – Fred Rogers
    “One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one’s work is terribly important.”
    – Bertrand Russell
    “When we long for life without difficulties, remind us that oaks grow strong in contrary winds and diamonds are made under pressure.”
    – Peter Marshall
    “Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under the trees on a summer’s day, listening to the murmur of water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.”
    – John Lubbock
    “There is more to life than increasing its speed.”
    – Mahatma Gandhi
    “When I look back on all these worries, I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathbed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life, most of which had never happened.”
    – Winston Churchill
    “Rule number one is, don’t sweat the small stuff. Rule number two is, it’s all small stuff.”
    – Robert Eliot
    “Don’t underestimate the value of Doing Nothing, of just going along, listening to all the things you can’t hear, and not bothering.”
    – Winnie the Pooh

    Hello
    I really like the look of your blog. I was wondering which website you used to make this as it looks very simple and easy to look at. And was it free?
    Because I would like to make a blog myself but everything costs something and I am only 13 so I can’t actually pay for a website like that. Or if not, do you know of one? Thank you. :) I also like your posts aswell. If it is no trouble, could you please take a little look at my website? It’s not very good but oh well. 😀 thank you. god bless you
