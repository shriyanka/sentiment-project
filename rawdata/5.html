This a decision I didn‚Äôt make lightly. I found myself going back and forth a million times. Lists of pros and cons. How could I POSSIBLY not have GML as part of my life? How could I let my readers down? Will people think I‚Äôm being a quitter? Who am I, if not for the ‚Äúgirl‚Äù behind Girl Meets Life?

While I‚Äôve got some reasons below (mostly because I‚Äôm a verbal processor / feel like I need to give at least some sort of explanation), the truth is that this decision is one made mostly based on my gut. I can‚Äôt explain why, but this is something I just know I have to do. And when I get that feeling, I know I have to go with it. You‚Äôve probably noticed I‚Äôve been less than active on GML over the past few months, so I don‚Äôt think this should be the biggest shock.

If you‚Äôve been a long time reader of GML, you‚Äôve seen me go through quite the journey. From being a naive college grad who barely knew a thing about her identity, to moving to NYC, making a life for myself here, and essentially becoming the woman I am today.

I can honestly say I would not be who I am today if it were not for GML. This blog taught me how to express myself. It challenged me to dig deep into who I am and what I want my life to look like. It dug up some not-so-pretty things I knew I wanted to change about myself, and helped me embrace things that I once tried to hide.

Most importantly, GML has been a way to share my voice and form relationships with women all over the globe ‚Äì women I may never see face to face, but will always have a special place in my heart. I cannot even begin to thank each and every one of you for the comments, emails, and kind words you‚Äôve left me over the years. You have truly impacted my life more than you know.

You may be wondering the why behind this decision, and there are a few reasons. For the most part, I‚Äôm just ready to move on to new things. A new season. GML has been an amazing chapter in my life, but in many ways I just feel like I‚Äôve grown out of it.

GML just doesn‚Äôt get me fired up like it used to. It has started to feel like more of a chore, and I realized that I owe you all more than keeping it alive with subpar posts just for the sake of keeping it alive. When I discovered that other things started giving me that fired up/passionate feeling, I realized that it wasn‚Äôt just another phase. I thought about just keeping GML alive and posting here and there when I felt like it, but honestly it kills me to be that half-assed about it. That wouldn‚Äôt be doing justice to what I‚Äôve built + been so passionate about for so many years. I‚Äôd much rather take some time off and see if the passion comes back in time.

I hate to be that person who leaves an annoying little caveat, but the truth is that I may come back to GML one of these days. I believe I‚Äôm entering into a new season of life ‚Äì one that doesn‚Äôt include GML ‚Äì but I could see myself needing/wanting the platform again in the future. I guess we‚Äôll see.

So‚Ä¶what now? That‚Äôs a question I don‚Äôt fully know the answer to, and that really excites me. I‚Äôll be pouring myself into my job and other projects I‚Äôve been working on.

You can also still find me on social media if you‚Äôd like ‚Äì Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Snapchat (alagracie).

Once again, I can‚Äôt tell you enough how thankful I am for these amazing years getting to share my life with you and getting to know you. I love you all and hope we can stay in touch!

Goodbye, friends.

7 tips for getting ready at the gym {feat. Dove Dry Spray}.

24 November, 2015 by Gracie 1 Comment

I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äì showering and getting ready at the gym (or more often, in a SoulCycle locker room) is kinda sorta when I can turn into a bit of a diva. I‚Äôve just gotten so used to my creature comforts of getting ready at home that I just dread having to do it elsewhere.

But obviously life happens, and if I want to squeeze a workout into a busy day sometimes getting ready at the gym and going right to my next destination is the best bet. So here are some tips and tricks I‚Äôve learned over the years to make getting ready at the gym quicker and easier.

1) Dry shampoo. No surprise there! Depending on how sweaty I got during a workout (sexy, I know) I sometimes can skip washing my hair, and a generous sprinkle/spray of dry shampoo can do the trick.

2) Use a wet (as cold as possible) towel on your face & neck. One of the things I hate most about getting ready directly after working out is that I don‚Äôt have as much time as I‚Äôd like to let my body cool down. Ideally I like to ice my face to help me cool down (and relieve any puffiness), but a cold towel can help do the trick too.

3) Travel-size everything. You can get just about anything in travel size now ‚Äì a hair dryer, curling iron, straightener, toiletries, etc. If you‚Äôre regularly getting ready at the gym, the less you have to carry around throughout the day can make the process less of a pain.

4) Roll your clothes instead of folding them. This tip is a game changer when it comes to packing in general as it helps avoid wrinkling. It Also saves space in your gym bag.

5) Use a backpack. I know I know, backpacks aren‚Äôt exactly the most glamorous accessory. But if you‚Äôre going to be walking a lot with your gym/work stuff, it‚Äôs much more manageable than carrying everything in a shoulder bag. If you have a car and don‚Äôt need to carry much stuff ‚Äì disregard this (and I envy you ;)).

6) master the top knot. Sometimes despite your best efforts, hair can be the biggest struggle when it comes to getting ready at the gym. So in the event that you either don‚Äôt have time to blow it out, or you just can‚Äôt get the frizz under control, a great top knot can be a life saver. Paired with a pair of earrings and a bold lip ‚Äì you can save yourself time and effort.

7) Dove Dry Spray. I‚Äôm pretty picky when it comes to the right deodorant. I want something that does the job, smells great, but also doesn‚Äôt leave any weird residue. Right now I‚Äôm loving Dove Dry Spray, which was introduced to me by Simply Stylist. It provides all the care of Dove in a dry spray format ‚Äì a way to experience real skin care benefits from a deodorant.

Dove Dry Spray doesn‚Äôt leave behind visible residue and protects from perspiration for 48 hours. It goes on instantly dry for a cleaner feel ‚Äì the perfect option for when you‚Äôre on the go (AKA definitely when getting ready at the gym). Go to Dove.com to learn more!

how i broke up with stress (and how you can too).

20 November, 2015 by Gracie 13 Comments

Stress. It‚Äôs one of those sneaky things that can actually rule your entire life without you even fully realizing it.

If I‚Äôm being honest, stress has been at the forefront of my life for longer than I‚Äôd care to admit. As someone who lives in New York City (not the most easygoing city in the world) and has been self-employed for most of my adult life (not exactly the ‚Äúsafest‚Äù gig out there) ‚Äì I don‚Äôt really have the cards playing in my favor when it comes to living a stress-free life. And because of that, I‚Äôve kind of given myself the excuse of living with stress without thinking there was anything I could do about it.

But here‚Äôs the thing I‚Äôve been learning about stress ‚Äì it actually has very little to do with your circumstances, and so much more to do with your mindset/attitude.

After a recent resurgence of stress in my life, I had what I‚Äôd like to call an ‚Äúoh HELL no‚Äù moment where I decided I just don‚Äôt want to live that way anymore. Living under the fog of stress is not what I want for the rest of my adult life (which ‚Äì let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äì isn‚Äôt going to get any easier). I decided that instead of succumbing to stress as a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù part of life ‚Äì I was going to fight it with everything I‚Äôve got.

So here are some things that have helped me exponentially become free from stress, and I think they can help you do the same.

How I Broke Up With Stress

Pray for deliverance.
This is absolutely the first and most important step in becoming free from the grips of stress. God makes it very clear that we are not to worry (Matthew 6) and to seek and pursue peace (Psalm 34:14), and I fully believe that He can deliver us fully from all stress, fear, and anxiety. Oftentimes it‚Äôs just a matter of asking Him.

Face the issue when (if) it actually happens.
For me, the main trigger of stress is worrying about something that actually has not even happened. Oftentimes we can dwell on those made up scenarios ‚Äì no matter how likely or unlikely they may be ‚Äì that they become a reality in our minds. This is definitely a constant mind shift that has to take place, but I‚Äôve started to make a habit out of telling myself ‚Äúif/when that scenario ever happens, then you‚Äôre allowed to be concerned. But until then‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not even a reality.‚Äù

Because here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì most of the time, dealing with the ACTUAL situation when it happens is much more manageable and not as painful as we make it up in our minds to be. So why not just face the issue when it comes, rather than let it paralyze us in fear and stress before it‚Äôs even a reality?

Don‚Äôt verbally affirm that you‚Äôre stressed.
The words we speak over our lives have more power than we realize. Instead of coming into agreement with stress, speak out AGAINST it! When I feel stress creeping in, one of the first things I do is open my journal and write down all of the things I‚Äôm thankful for. The power of gratitude beats the grips of stress every time.

Break the idea that stress is normal.
The lie that stress is a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù part of life ‚Äì or even worse that it means we‚Äôre being RESPONSIBLE ‚Äì is one of the biggest and easiest lies to believe. Especially as someone who is self-employed, I constantly find myself feeling like I‚Äôm not working hard enough if I‚Äôm not completely overwhelmed with stress.

A practical thing that has helped with this is tracking my daily tasks (I use Toggl.com). I can look back at the end of the day and see that I did in fact accomplish a lot, and stress doesn‚Äôt have to be a part of that equation.

Take one day at a time.
Of course life will always have times that you have to consider the future. But as much as you can, try to finish each day and be done with it. As previously mentioned ‚Äì God tells us not to worry ‚Äì but He specifically says not to worry about tomorrow (Matthew 6:34). His grace is sufficient for THIS day.

Unplug from technology when you can.
This is something I definitely need to work on üòâ It‚Äôs still a struggle, but I‚Äôd love to get to the point where I‚Äôm off my phone/computer for an hour or two in the morning and before going to bed at night.

Repeat those things every. Single. Day.
Here‚Äôs the thing about all of those tips/tools ‚Äì they only work if you constantly remember and implement them in your life! Make it a daily habit to FIGHT stress before it creeps in. Be on the offense.

Which of these tips resonate with you most? Anything to add?

what i‚Äôm loving right now.

19 November, 2015 by Gracie 6 Comments

Hi hi friends! How is your week going?

Mine has been great ‚Äì a bit on the busy side as I‚Äôm getting all caught up before going home next week for Thanksgiving (yay).

I‚Äôm in the process of writing a post that I‚Äôm really excited about (hint ‚Äì it has to do with becoming free from STRESS), but in the mean time I wanted to share a few things I‚Äôm loving lately as we go full swing into the holiday season.

FITNESS ‚Äì Nike Flyknits
I got my first pair of Nike Flyknits a few months ago, and I loved them so much I went back last week and got them in a different color. These are my favorite sneakers ever ‚Äì they‚Äôre super comfortable and light weight ‚Äì perfect for casual wear but also working out.

Nike flyknit sneakers

FOOD ‚Äì Juice Press Roasted Veggie Salad
For the days that I‚Äôm on-the-go with meetings and what not (which, lately has been at least twice a week), Juice Press is definitely my ‚Äúfast food‚Äù of choice. I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äì I‚Äôm not usually the biggest salad girl in the world. But their new Roasted Veggie Salad is really hearty and flavorful ‚Äì it tastes like fall! Juice Press stores are only local BUT they ship nationally if you ever want to give it a try (their juices, desserts, etc. are all amazing).

FASHION ‚Äì Rado Chocolate Ceramic Watches
The other night I stopped by a Rado watch event, and I was so glad I did. It was at the Francois Payard patisserie on the Upper East Side, and we were treated with goodies like chocolates, wine, and macarons.

IMG_3819

The event was to highlight Rado‚Äôs new Chocolate Ceramic watch collection, and they were seriously SO beautiful. Rado watches are made of high-tech ceramic which qualities include hypo-allergenic, highly scratch resistant and durable. Being ceramic, the watches are extremely lightweight and provide ultimate comfort to the wearer.

The new chocolate collection is the newest ceramic color to the brand and provides a fashion-forward unique look in a beautiful warm, earthen tone. I really loved the look and feel of the ceramic (which was actually very lightweight), and the chocolate shade was so chic for fall and winter.

LIFE ‚Äì it‚Äôs beginning to look a lot like‚Ä¶
Christmaaaaas üòÄ I was in Midtown yesterday for a meeting and took the opportunity to make a stop at Macy‚Äôs. With the decorations, gift displays, and music‚Ä¶let‚Äôs just say I am now very much in the Christmas spirit. If you‚Äôve never been able to experience NYC during the holidays ‚Äì you absolutely must add it to your bucket list. There‚Äôs nothing like it!

ON THE WEB ‚Äì Self Made From Scratch
I‚Äôve been meaning to do more shout-outs here on GML to people on the ‚Äònet that I think are doing rad things ‚Äì and Jenny from Self Made From Scratch is the first person who came to mind. I‚Äôve known Jenny via the blog world for a while now (she created this GML design!), and what she‚Äôs doing with her new business is so incredible. If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about how to start your own blog/business, I couldn‚Äôt recommend her more.

life lately.

12 November, 2015 by Gracie 8 Comments

It‚Äôs been quite a while since I‚Äôve given a life update here on GML, huh?

If you follow me on social media you‚Äôve probably seen most of what I‚Äôve been up to, so I‚Äôll spare you from sharing all the recaps üòâ But here are a few things going on that I‚Äôm pretty excited about that I wanted to share with you.

life lately

1) I‚Äôve taken on a larger role at NYC Collective.
For the past 8 months I‚Äôve been the Social Media Director at NYC Collective, but I‚Äôm now transitioning into a Managing Director role, and I couldn‚Äôt be more excited about it. I can‚Äôt wait to step into bigger responsibilities like creating campaigns, building new programs, and managing our team. And as if my schedule couldn‚Äôt get any more flexible, this actually frees me up even more to focus on some new (and existing) projects I‚Äôve been putting to the side.

2) Speakable got a little makeover.
‚Ä¶in the form of a new upper case font, at least :) What do you think? I‚Äôm personally in love with this new look.

(p.s. if you‚Äôre interested in placing a holiday order, be sure to do so by November 30th!)

Speakable

3) Without fail, I re-fall in love with the city every autumn.
You guys ‚Äì there is absolutely nothing like New York City in the fall. If you ever plan a visit here, try to make it in October or November! The past few weeks have been full of so many fun and exciting adventures. Even something as simple as riding bikes through Central Park over the weekend pretty much made my heart explode (I‚Äôm dramatic though, what can I say? :))

4) Speaking of re-falling in love with the city, on Monday I paid a visit to Asanda Spa Lounge in Soho for a full afternoon of pampering. They were generous enough to gift me with a massage, facial, pedicure AND blowout! I felt like a queen all day, to say the least.

For those of you in NYC (or visiting for the holidays), I couldn‚Äôt recommend Asanda Spa more. I‚Äôve been to a handful of spas and salons in New York, but few of them have such a full list of service offerings. If you‚Äôre interested in going yourself OR getting someone a gift, you can email info@asandaspa.com to book and use promo code ‚ÄòGML20‚Äô for 20% off!
