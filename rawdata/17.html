Few things have such a huge impact on happiness and the enjoyment, depth and plain fun of life as the friendships we have.

It could be the friendships with our partners, family members, co-workers and the people we have known for a few years now or since we were kids. Or even with people we have never even met at the other side of the world or the pets we love.

So I’d like to start 2016 by looking back and share some of the best advice on this topic from the people who have walked this earth over the past hundreds and thousands of years.

This is 74 thought-provoking, beautiful, sometimes poignant and sometimes funny quotes on friendship.
