“New
Year’s
eve
like
every
night
pause
march
universe
breathless
moment

The
year
coming
end
Just
one
day
go
But
step
doorway
I’d
like
quickly
share
one
last
article
favorite
questions
help
shape
2016
focused
self-kinder
successful
year
Stay
safe
enjoy
New
Year’s
celebration
see
next
year
Is
useful
It’s
easy
spend
lot
time
things
really
matter
much
To
spend
hours
days
even
weeks
angry
someone
replaying
mistake
failure
one’s
mind
dwell
something
negative
feeling
like
victim
So
I
try
ask
question
often
I
question
confront
thoughts
To
catch
wake
I
get
stuck
negative
thought
loops
going
round
round
By
I
Suffer
less
Waste
less
time
going
round
circles
Spend
time
finding
practical
solution
What
important
thing
I
right
If
get
lost
day
week
life
question
helpful
It
might
always
give
answer
want
important
thing
right
often
one
harder
things
But
help
truly
focus
things
matters
area
life
And
feels
hard
get
started
ask
yourself…
What
one
small
step
I
take
right
get
ball
rolling
This
favorite
question
I
want
get
started
something
I
want
get
going
something
fallen
side
reason
Because
makes
things
easier
Makes
feel
lighter
This
question
prevents
trying
escape
procrastination
helps
avoid
side-effects
sinking
self-esteem
self-loathing
simply
lot
time
wasted
trying
hide
Is
anyone
planet
worse
right
This
question
seldom
deliver
enjoyable
answers
sure
snap
negative
thinking
feeling
sorry
Now
I
think
natural
sometimes
feel
sad
sorry
little
If
don’t
take
time
process
natural
responses
negative
situations
feelings
pop
later
And
feel
inexplicably
sad
might
get
angry
irritated
people
good
reason
But
experience
also
things
go
far
It’s
easy
get
stuck
disempowering
thoughts
long
So
I
like
use
question
zoom
I
feel
perspective
become
self-centered
narrow
And
years
taught
lot
things
I
often
may
take
granted
grateful
life
Will
matter
years
Or
even
weeks
This
one
helps
simplify
To
let
go
To
make
mountain
molehill
To
find
healthier
happier
perspective
To
lose
focus
energy
crippling
worries
To
find
lightness
life
I
carry
around
tons
unnecessary
mental
baggage
It’s
truly
wonderful
question

My
Jobs
Toll
On
Me
As
weeks
turned
months
job
taking
toll
I
began
hate
job
I
dreaded
going
work
Sundays
worst
day
week
I
regularly
use
paid
time
call
sick
I
began
withdraw
friends
family
I
even
started
treat
girlfriends
ways
aren’t
typical
My
job
consuming
entirety
life
making
miserable
At
first
I
didn’t
even
notice
affecting
But
time
went
became
clear
I
allowing
job
completely
control
dictate
life
emotions
Deciding
Enough
Is
Enough
It
took
solid
two
years
get
point
I
able
stop
letting
job
control
I
driving
see
best
friend
weekend
hour
drive
alone
allowed
time
think
things
I
began
look
life
I
treating
others
around
I
also
looked
job
kept
sour
mood
majority
days
I
decided
drive
things
needed
change
Going
forward
I
longer
going
let
circumstances
day
work
affect
rest
life
I
began
put
positive
spin
everything
work
I
found
humor
situations
learned
laugh
instead
get
angry
Granted
I
never
laughed
loud
front
people
I
however
get
caught
times
big
grin
face
prompting
others
ask
funny
I
reply
“nothing”
keep
working
At
first
I
got
yelled
I
think
“at
least
I
didn’t
get
hit”
That
evolved
saying
“you
yell
want
second
I
walk
door
none
stuff
matters”
I
felt
sad
mutual
fund
tax
accounting
upset
someone
much
make
yell
berate
others
Either
true
passion
hate
job
much
I
I
also
realized
I
getting
yelled
wasn’t
necessarily
I
I
didn’t
know
It
I
wrong
place
wrong
time
My
co-workers
taking
anger
stress
didn’t
know
deal
better
way
As
time
went
positive
spins
work
evolved
became
easier
easier
stay
upbeat
positive
thoughts
work
I
began
leaving

I
usually
I

Things
Started
Going
My
Way
The
interesting
thing
I
started
focus
positive
side
things
expressed
appreciation
things
went
way
things
started
going

More
often
auditors
signed
numbers
cosmetic
changes
This
great
since
changing
one
number
changes
everything
else
tax
return
The
new
funds
I
assigned
less
complex
funds
making
job
easier
All
along
I
applying
jobs
I
never
heard
back
I
started
stay
positive
appreciative
Applications
began
get
responses
I
ended
finding
awesome
job
less
year
later
Staying
Positive
Is
The
Key
I
credit
everything
changed
staying
positive
Once
I
learned
stay
positive
focus
good
things
job
became
much
easier
Yes
I
still
hated
I
still
disliked
Sundays
But
I
wake
Sunday
morning
stare
clock
day
thinking
X
number
hours
I’m
back

Now
I
wake
Sunday
mornings
live

I
knew

Monday
work
right
around

I
refused

I’ll
give

100
attention
8am-4pm
No
If

hate

I
won’t
lie

going
hard
Start

You’ll
see
I

I
started
grateful
I
getting
yelled
let
build
laughing
dysfunction
department
realizing
I
scapegoat
others
releasing
anger
stress
If
learn
allow
work
consume
work
slowly
begin
see
change
outlook
attitude
outside
work
Slowly
surely
you’ll
come
enjoy
life
It
takes
courage
persevere
challenging
work-related
experiences
recall
detail
I
think
readers
identify
proverbial
job
hell
–
either
due
suffocating
boss
surly
co-workers
anxiety-provoking
work
demands
combination
imposing
elements
Work
dissatisfaction
easily
affect
quality
life
wise
compartmentalize
separate
work
life
home
life
making
mutually
exclusive
I
wish
problems
resolved
merely
communicating
feelings
supervisors
colleagues
For
example
seems
logical
employees
right
ask
questions
get
demeaned
asking
–
concern
voiced
However
people
act
thoughtless
way
may
engage
introspection
take
much
responsibility
inconsiderate
actions
Still
it’s
always
worth
try
two
resolve
problems
But
instead
waiting
someone
change
it’s
imperative
change
–
perceptions
attitudes
thoughts
regarding
process
difficulties
workplace
outside
Instead
feeling
like
victim
became
outside
observer
Of
interest
refused
internalize
harsh
treatment
favorable
results
started
surface
Thanks

I

Argentine
tango
class
six
years
ago
I
dressed
fishnet
stockings
black
dress
makeup…
that’s
supposed
I
thought
Within
minutes
entering
class
I
wanted
crawl
hole
somewhere
I
felt
exposed
awkward
intimidated
clumsy
You
know
feeling
weird
person
room
everyone
staring
That
feeling
I
remember
watching
gorgeous
teacher
gracefully
moving
front
mirror
I
trying
hide
disgust
reflection
And
another
person
front
holding
arms
tried

Our
society
sends
constant

We
need

work

We
combat

We

Our

We

When
I

life
first

figure

Not

I
started
going

When

When

Making

We

The

We
don’t

In

At

Hi
Jose
I
think
bring
great
points
Focusing
one
thing
time
important
long
term
goals
ie
changing
habits
daily
activities
well
I
think
agree
idea
‘multi-tasking’
usually
productive
The
key
opinion
concentrating
one
big
change
get
discouraged
I
think
that’s
I
used
try
many
things
past
I
started
losing
momentum
something
I’d
pick
something
else
This
course
led
nowhere
You
mentioned
changing
eating
habits
allowed
cheat
day
helped
stay
committed
I
think
that’s
great
way
help
focus
one
achievement
time
even
get
discouraged
slow
methods
place
adjust
plan
reward
hitting
certain
short-term
goals
This
way
stays
easier
get
distracted
another
completely
different
goal
Thanks

How
Become
Better
Listener
“I
like
listen
I
learned
great
deal
listening
carefully
Most
people
never
listen.”
Ernest
Hemingway
“Nature
gave
one
tongue
two
ears
hear
twice
much
speak.”
Epictetus
One
social
habit
I
used
quite
bad
truly
listen
people
spoke
I
sometimes
zoned
I
got
distracted
attention
started
wander
done
talking
Or
I
waited
turn
talk
thinking
I
say
next
Not
helpful
So
things
change
This
week
I’d
like
share
simple
tips
helped
–
still
helps
–
become
better
listener
I
hope
help
relationships
Keep
mind
Listening
win/win
Many
may
listen
well
think
don’t
get
much
personally
But
better
listen
better
listen
And
better
deeper
relationship
If
focus
understanding
giving
value
based
you’ll
get
thing
back
This
reminder
powerful
motivator
become
better
listener
Tell
you’ll
tell
someone
else
conversation
later
One
best
ways
remember
something
better
know
going
tell
learned
someone
else
Then
you’ll
alert
naturally
start
asking
questions
understand
said
–
experience
–
simply
seems
stick
better
Plus
you’ll
stop
focusing
much
say
next
conversation
tends
flow
better
Keep
eye-contact
Looking
everywhere
except
person
talking
make
seem
like
listening
And
conversation
suffers
So
keep
eye-contact
I
found
easier
start
often
I
Took
step-by-small-step
improved
eye-contact
time
conversations
span
months
Focused
gaze
one
person’s
eyes
time
Keep
smart
phone
away
Browsing
internet
phone
computer
trying
listen
usually
leads
missing
part
conversation
person
talking
feeling
like
listened
So
put
phone
listening
don’t
need
check
something
write
something
part
conversation
Summarize
said
I
found
taking
seconds
summarize
someone
said
–
like
longer
segment
happened
work
relationship
–
makes
lot
easier
make
sure
I’ve
understood
happened
As
I
say
summary
loud
person
adjust
correct
understanding
I
add
perspective
thoughts
questions
better
way
based
rather
assumptions
happened
person’s
experienced
situation
Or
I
take
kind
action
based
actually
meant
I
thought
meant
example
work
setting
misunderstanding
lead
frustration
time
lost
misunderstand
6
Ask
instead
trying
mind-read
Reading
someone’s
mind
quite
difficult
Most
time
impossible
Still
many
tried
started
conversations
based
many
times
So
feel
impulse
assume
mind-read
stop
start
curious
ask
open-ended
questions
Going
kind
question
instead
ones
person
answer
yes
help
him/her
open
start
explaining
sharing
going
7
Get
fresh
air
and/or
exercise
Few
things
make
hard
follow
along
conversation
tired
foggy
head
Two
things
keep
energy
mental
clarity
open
window
take
walk
outside
get
exercise
fresh
air
Exercising
regularly
bit
intensely
times
week
also
makes
easier
fully
want
need
listen
When
listen
listen
Don’t
interrupt
Don’t
jump
solutions
one
hard
one
experience
Just
present
moment
listen
fully
person
say
let
speak
entire
message
said
Sometimes
also
that’s
needed
For
someone
truly
listen
vent
minutes
figure
things
Be
honest
current
limitations
If
you’re
rush
feel
tired
stressed
let
person
know
If
listened
long
mind
hit
limit
starts
wander
need
break
maybe
something
eat
process
said
something
else
say
It
better
honest
continue
conversation
later
try
fake
undivided
attention
try
keep
listening

When
asked

–

How
Stop
Being
So
Lazy
Simple
Habits
“How
soon
‘not
now’
becomes
‘never’.”
Martin
Luther
When
I
younger
early
twenties
I
often
lazy
Too
often
actually
And
I
didn’t
Get
school
work
done
good
way
cram
stress
days
exam
Work
cook
healthy
food
felt
hard
I
gained
30+
pounds
weight
fitness
levels
went
Take
care
personal
growth
dreams
mostly
let
slide
“someday”
things
remained
daydreams
10+
years
later
I
still
love
lazying
around
much
But
I’ve
also
learned
keep
lazy
time
moderate
healthy
amount
instead
letting
hold
back
stuck
place
excuses
years
like
used
This
week
I’d
like
share
simple
habits
helped
make
change
To
stop
lazy
get
really
matters
done
working
smarter
While
still
room
guilt-free
lazy
time
spend
I
like
Be
kind
When
feel
you’ve
perhaps
lazy
lately
it’s
common
tempting
beat
hope
lead
start
taking
action
Sometimes
But
I
found
beating
often
leads
feeling
guiltier
like
failure
And
feel
less
motivated
get
going
procrastinate
seems
little
point
even
trying
Instead
getting
stuck
self-esteem
sucking
place
I
recommend
gently
nudge
towards
next
tip
article
whenever
feel
like
want
beat
Start
small
step
forward
The
hardest
thing
often
simply
get
started
So
make
easy
reduce
inner
resistance
actually
take
action
Start
taking
small
step
forward
Go
running
minutes
Do
dishes
minutes
Write
report
you’ve
procrastinating
minutes
I
use
habit
almost
every
day
way
I’m
example
creating
new
course
daily
aim
past
months
usually
write
page
day
And
writing
done
aim
I
start
day
often
edit
page
That’s
But
never
stopped
page
months
I
written
edited
whole
bunch
day
Do
small
part
matters
first
thing
day
To
feel
like
enjoy
lazy/rest
time
fully
without
guilt
it’s
important
actually
get
truly
matters
long
run
done
week
So
start
day
But
make
easy
breaking
task
smaller
steps
focus
first
one
Get
right
away
get
effective
focused
mindset
By
set
good
tone
day
You
get
quick
5-10
minute
win
first
thing
you’ll
lot
motivated
keep
going
path
rest
day
Instead
starting
busy
work
like
checking
emails
–
may
vital
first
thing
many
it’s
probably
–
checking
Facebook
etc
30
minutes
later
getting
started
today’s
work
Cycle
fully
focused
work
small
breaks
rest/lazy
time
To
lighten
daily
work
inject
small
breaks
short
focused
burst
work
Say
I’ll
20
minutes
work
task
I
take
minutes
lazy
time
By
breaking
hours
like
work
seems
less
daunting
And
you’ll
feel
energetic
motivated
longer
work
better
quality
allow
pauses
rest
time
lazy
around
Facebook
game
relaxing
grass
short
walk
park
Then
time
may
want
work
40
minutes
take
minute
break
But
go
easy
first
And
trouble
sticking
time-limits
use
app
phone
simple
egg-timer
kitchen
Shut
escape
routes
temporarily
Just
sitting
example
computer
trying
fully
focused
work
20
minutes
may
result
work
importance
getting
done
Not
don’t
remove
things
usually
use
procrastinate
So
ask
I
usually
escape
instead
work
For
it’s
example
often
smart
phone
checking
Reddit
Twitter
random
internet
browsing
So
I
put
phone
silent
mode
I
put
end
home
I
work
By
setting
small
physical
obstacle
I
avoid
phone
trap
maybe
95
time
If
Have
issue
gaming
put
controller
far
away
home
working
Escape
Facebook
websites
computer
block
little
using
example
StayFocusd
Watch
TV
pull
cords
Or
remove
one
cords
completely
put
end
home
6
List
downsides
upsides
renewed
motivation
Asking
better
questions
tend
give
better
answers
Two
sets
questions
I
sat
asked
closed
eyes
refueled
motivation
many
times
How
life
look
years
I
continue
stay
path
How
life
likely
become
worse
maybe
even
people
around
This
like
beating
rather
sober
examination
it’s
realistic
you’re
heading
And
may
uncomfortable
try
see
negative
consequences
vividly
mind
kickstart
motivation
get
going
positive
change
Then
ask
How
life
look
year
I
get
started
stick
keep
going
change
How
life
improve
people
I
love
I
stick
7
Unclutter
life
When
life’s
cluttered
overwhelming
may
shut
procrastinate
lying
lazily
couch
watching
TV
smart
phone
When
that’s
case
start
uncluttering
work
hours
private
time
Two
questions
helped
find
important
What
I
work
I
hours
work
today
If
I
hour
free
time
today
I
spend
Use
get
old
rut
question
normal
day
bit
find
top
priorities
Then
see
eliminate
minimize
perhaps
delegate
things
contained
answers
Be
OK
stumbling
time
time
The
fear
failure
hold
back
state
easier
things
may
see
lazy
But
everyone
go
truly
want
outside
comfort
zone
stumbles
fails
time
time
That’s
part
life
well
lived
even
don’t
hear
people’s
setbacks
often
successes
See
setback
learning
experience
way
constructive
kinder
You
asking
two
questions
you’ve
stumbled
What
thing
I
learn
situation
How
best
friend/parent
support
help
situation
Then
talk
things
like
Let
enthusiasm
energy
motivation
others
Whatever
let
mind
life
influence
If
people
hang
generally
bit
lazy
work
school
it’s
easy
adapt
mood
way
thinking
go
But
spend
time
motivated
people
real
life
via
books
internet
podcasts
audio
books
start
influence
thinking
mood
So
think
let
mind
daily
weekly
basis
want
make
changes
Truly
appreciate
enjoy
lazy
time
Time
spent
lazying
around
helps
relax
recharge
makes
happy
But
I
much
become
less
healthy
It
Starts
frustrate
I’m
moving
forward
towards
I
want
Creates
stress
instead
relaxing
I’m
getting
what’s
important
done
negative
consequences
quite
soon
Still
moderate
amount
spending
time
lazy
truly
beneficial
And
I’ve
found
think
little
want
spend
lazy
time
–
matter
it’s
minute
break
lazy
Sunday
–
use
time
something
really
enjoy
like
reading
book
love
rather
aimlessly
watching
TV-shows
you’re
OK
time
brings
happiness
fulfillment
I’ve
also
learned
I
spend
lazy
time
conscious
way
I’m
motivated
energized
go
back
work
later
So
I
make
sure
appreciate
fully
enjoy
lazy
time
I
create
I
know
benefit
several
important
ways

Stop

Overthinking
make

actually
It
hold
back

What
instead
Set
short
time-limits
decisions
For
example
For
small
decisions
like
go
laundry
start
writing
new
article
work
I
usually
give
30
seconds
less
make
decision
For
somewhat
larger
decisions
taken
days
weeks
think
past
I
set
deadline
30
minutes

Keep

Spending

time
past
usually
leads
going
old
mistakes
failures
wishing
go
back

And
spending

time
thinking
future
usually
leads

You’ll
feel

Reconnect

Stop

A

make
set
high

And
I
usually
felt
happy
I
achieved
something

You
don’t

And
decreased
drive
achieve

Instead
made

And
path
I
want

happier
one

Stop
comparing

Comparing

daily
habit
You

self-esteem
low
feel
like

The
progress
made
towards

And
don’t
forget
celebrate

“Our
doubts
traitors
make
lose
good
oft
might
win
fearing
attempt.”
William
Shakespeare
Self-doubt
troubling
persuasive
voice
holds
back
It
holds
back
seizing
opportunities
It
makes
getting
started
finishing
things
harder
need
Sure
sometimes
useful
helps
soberly
see
current
limitations
simply
recognize
half-baked
bad
idea
But
mostly
holds
back
life
So
get
around
overcome
times
self-doubt
move
forward
In
article
I’ll
explore
tips
habits
helped
decrease
destructive
inner
voice
Say
stop
First
inner
doubts
bubble
quick
Don’t
let
spin
control
grow
whisper
stream
discouraging
sentences
Instead
talk
back
doubtful
part
In
mind
say
shout
something
like
No
going
road
By
disrupt
thought
pattern
stop
inner
self-doubter
taking
Look
past
awash
memories
Be
real
ask
How
many
times
I
doubted
feared
something
happen
negative
thing
come
reality
I
still
took
action
The
answer
–
probably
–
often
Self-doubts
often
monsters
head
mind
may
use
keep
making
changes
keep
within
comfort
zone
If
look
past
see
well
things
gone
many
times
despite
self-doubts
become
easier
let
go
ignore
focus
likely
positive
outcome
take
action
Talk
someone
When
keep
thoughts
inside
become
distorted
exaggerated
much
line
reality
reasonable
expectations
This
much
true
comes
self-doubting
thoughts
So
let
light
Talk
someone
close
self-doubts
Just
letting
saying
loud
often
help
hear
exaggerated
thoughts
become
And
talking
doubts
someone
supportive
get
change
perspective
Start
keeping
journal
Keeping
journal
helpful
habit
many
reasons
When
comes
self-doubts
help
Keep
realistic
record
life
And
help
remember
positive
things
successes
overcome
obstacles
prone
remembering
things
negative
slant
Gain
clarity
easily
It
often
easier
alleviate
fears
doubts
gain
clarity
issue
laid
paper
computer
document
rather
try
go
mind
By
making
lists
pros
cons
going
thoughts
emotions
similar
events
past
writing
different
perspectives
issue
becomes
easier
find
solutions
see
challenge
clearer
level-headed
way
Remember
people
don’t
care
much
say
When
worry
others
may
think
say
something
self-doubt
quickly
become
stronger
get
stuck
inaction
fear
When
happens
remind
truth
people
don’t
really
care
much
They
hands
full

worrying
people
may

See
setback
temporary
When
setback
easy
start
doubting
To
start
seeing
current
setback
something
simply
new
normal
This
way
looking
things
trap
thinking
there’s
point
continuing
take
action
So
instead
Remember
You
failure
failed
Setbacks
happen
everyone
take
chances
It
simply
part
living
life
fully
Sometimes
things
go
well
sometimes
don’t
So
don’t
make
failure
huge
thing
identity
Ask
one
thing
I
learn
setback
Use
mistake
failure
advantage
move
forward
smarter
way
Sharpen
skills
If
instance
often
get
self-doubt
presentation
school
work
sharpen
presentation
skills
Read
books
practice
home
front
mirror
front
friend
Or
join
Toastmasters
get
experience
knowledge
need
Then
you’ll
feel
confident
competent
relaxed
situations
Don’t
beat
A
common
way
handle
self-doubt
get
angry
lack
motion
forward
To
try
beat
way
get
move
forward
That
–
experience
–
help
much
I
found
kind
constructive
feeling
self-doubt
better
choice
So
I
use
kind
understanding
words
towards
I
also
ask
What
one
small
step
I
take
move
forward
situation
Then
I
take
small
step
start
step
step
move
towards
I
want
go
Remember
You
course-correct
along
way
Trying
plan
every
move
make
journey
towards
goal
dream
become
draining
lead
quite
bit
self-doubt
And
usually
don’t
work
well
anyway
since
best
laid

So
bit
rough
planning
start

And
remember
always

Empowered

“Be

Whatever

I

A

usually
works

Be

But
don’t

So
try

Be

To

When

Then
keep

Compare

Instead
deflating
motivation
comparing

far
ahead
Compete
friendly
way
When
you’re
school
work
make
friendly
competition
friend
example
finish
boring
routine
task
first
Just
element
competition
tends
liven
things
And
want
also
add
small
prize
extra
motivation
like
winner
getting
free
ice
cream
beer
person
Remind
working
toward
When
you’re
feeling
unmotivated

energy
easy
lose

you’re

So
take
minutes
write
top
reasons
work
getting

working
saving
extra
money
something
else
Put
note
see
every
day
keep
smartphone
easy
access
need
motivational
boost
Remind
you’re
moving
away
You
also
motivate
get
going
looking
negative

staying
current
path
Ask
What
consequences
I
continue
path
year
And
I
years
I
found
exercise
given
kick-start
I
needed
many
times
past
years
Be
grateful
got
When
motivation
running
low
it’s
easy
start
seeing
life
aspects
negative
lens
To
put
focus
still
–
recharge
positivity
motivation
­–
ask
question
like
What
things
I
sometimes
take
granted
grateful
life
My
answers
example
roof
head
clean
water
go
hungry
Mix
things
A
rut
kill
motivation
So
mix
things
Make
competition
task
someone
else
When
work
vary
instead
going
motions
Listen
music
podcasts
usually
don’t
listen
New
input
variation
tends
good
way
keep
motivation
recharge
Declutter
workspace
Take
couple
minutes
clean
I
find
uncluttered
minimalistic
workspace
helps
think
clearly
I
feel
focused
ready
tackle
next
task
small
step
Don’t
forget
breaks
Few
things
experience
drain
daily
motivation
like
working
non-stop
Instead
work
45
minutes
hour
use
rest
break
eat
snack
got
fresh
air
bit
stretching
You’ll
–
perhaps
somewhat
counter-intuitively
–
get
done
day
week
work
higher
quality
energy
focus
motivation
simply
last
longer
Adjust
goal
size
If
big
goal
life
feels
overwhelming
set
smaller
goal
find
motivation
And
smaller
goal
doesn’t
seem
inspiring
try
aim
higher
make
bigger
goal
see
affects
motivation
Exercise
Working
doesn’t
affect
body
I
find
20-30
minutes
lifting
free
weights
releases
inner
tensions
stress
makes
feel
focused
motivated
Take
minutes
look
back
successes
Close
eyes
let
memories
biggest
successes
–
matter
part
life
–
wash
Let
positive
memories
boost
motivation
Do
bit
research
get
started
Learning
people
gone
want
go
done
want
help
avoid
pitfalls
And
give
realistic
time-table
success
This
important
get
demotivated
things
aren’t
happening
fast
wished
Take
minute
meditation
break
This
something
I
done
past
months
When
mind
bit
tired
perhaps
even
overloaded
energy
motivation
goes
So
afternoons
–
needed
–
I
tend
sit
closed
eyes
focus
breathing
minutes
This
clears
mind
releases
inner
tensions
Go
nature
Few
things
give
much
new
energy
motivation
take
life
So
I
often
go
walk
woods
sea
I’m
moment
nature
fresh
air
I
don’t
think
anything
special

7
favorite
tips
living
simpler
life
also
successful
one
I
hope
you’ll
find
tips
strategies
helpful
I’ve
found
years
The
secret
getting
ahead…
“The
secret
getting
ahead
getting
started
The
secret
getting
started
breaking
complex
overwhelming
tasks
small
manageable
tasks
starting
first
one.”
When
start
look
far
future
task
project
seem
close
impossible
And
shut
become
overwhelmed
fearful
success
failure
start
surfing
internet
aimlessly
So
instead
Break
task
small
practical
steps
Then
focus
taking
first
step
today
That
need
focus
nothing
else
By
taking
first
step
change
mental
state
resistant
“hey
I’m
cool”
You
put
state
become
positive
open
state
may
enthusiastic
taking
next
step
first
one
least
accepting
And
take
next
step
And
next
one
Until
arrived
destination
completion
Less
talking
“Action
speaks
louder
words
nearly
often”
“There
basically
two
types
people
People
accomplish
things
people
claim
accomplished
things
The
first
group
less
crowded.”
It’s
often
easy
talk
developing
habit
person
action
quite
bit
harder
Being
habit
breaking
task
smaller
pieces
one
effective
things
take
consistent
action
Two
habits
work
well
Start
day
positive
morning
routine
A
good
start
often
leads
good
day
A
bad
indecisive
start
often
leads
pretty
mediocre
day
So
create
morning
routine
reliably
gets
good
great
start
Mine
includes
good
breakfast
positive
information
I
eat
first
meal
day
getting
started
important
task
day
right
away
I
start
working
Block
distractions
Before
take
one
small
steps
forward
make
sure
created
zone
lot
less
likely
distracted
disturbed
So
shut
internet
use
blocker
program
visited
websites
Put
phone
silent
mode
somewhere
can’t
see
Close
door
room
Then
get
work
Be
courageous
face
fear
“Courage
resistance
fear
mastery
fear
–
absence
fear.”
Being
courageous
difficult
want
live
life
want
live
sometimes
look
face
fear
get
going
keep
going
anyway
And
although
rarely
easy
courageous
I
found
ways
make
easier
Ask
worst
happen
Don’t
think
seconds
Sit
pen
piece
paper
laptop
Write
think
realistic
worst-case
scenario
Then
write
plan
come
back
scenario
This
brings
clarity
defuses
fuzzy
fears
helps
realize
often
bounce
back
pretty
quickly
even
worst-case
scenario
somehow
becomes
reality
Share
fear
someone
By
keeping
inside
it’s
easy
build
fear
massive
nightmare
extremely
dangerous
thing
By
sharing
getting
input
levelheaded
friend
family
member
help
alleviate
fear
inner
pressure
And
gain
much
healthier
perspective
things
Accept
fear
It
natural
impulse
try
deny
fear
shows
life
Perhaps
try
think
try
push
away
I
found
many
cases
actually
better
accept
fear
right
After
minutes
fully
taking
uncomfortable
feeling
accepting
starts
lose
steam
You
stopped
feeding
energy
fear
And
seems
float
away
–
least
becomes
smaller
–
feel
open
centered
A
good
compliment
wonderful
thing
“I
live
two
months
good
compliment.”
Compliments
awesome
But
make
sure
make
A
genuine
one
Make
sure
really
mean
may
opposite
effect
insincerity
shines
Something
bit
unexpected
Like
great
taste
old
soul
music
rather
something
person
heard
hundred
times
like
example
looks
Something
important
person
Keep
positive
company
“Keep
away
people
try
belittle
ambitions
Small
people
always
really
great
make
feel
become
great.”
I
mentioned
many
times
But
bears
repeating
Spend
time
positive
people
books
music
movies
podcasts
websites
Spend
time
environment
lifts
And
spend
less
time
time
negative
sources
Make
conscious
choice
start
shape
environment
instead
going
along
reading
listening
watching
people
general
people
around
may
habit
consuming
6
Focus
truly
important
YOU
“Many
small
thing

right
kind

Make
conscious
choice
focus
important
YOUR
life
And
things
various
companies
–
people
–
may
tell
important
things
Like
I
mentioned
last
week
note
important
things
life
smartly
placed
see
every

–
helps
keep

consistently
top

And
want
couple
practical
tips
help
declutter
ad/information
intake
Ask
useful
If
instance
TV-show
magazine
isn’t
bringing
anything
useful
–
fun
fascination
useful
tips
etc
–
I
spending
time
It’s
kinda
easy
fall
habit
stuff
consuming
things
without
really
much
reason
Find
really
like
That
probably
interesting
surfing
internet
TV-channels
randomly
And
less
exciting
things
tend
fall
away
life
find
–
spend
time
–
things
really
like
like
instance
new
hobby

When

exploding…
wait
“Time

It’s
easy
make
bad

negative
emotions
And
easy
become
riled
angry
defensive
instance
receive
criticism
someone
attacking
verbally
This
good

And
lash

subtle
subtle
self-destructiveness
But
control
impulse

overreact
make
hasty
decision
Remind
potential

I
don’t
want
hurt
self-esteem
make
bad
decisions
negative
consequences
By
repeatedly
reminding
potential
consequences
also
often
pop
automatically
I
receive
criticism
I

Count

take
belly
breaths
Then
respond
This
simple
way
calming

something
can’t
take
back
Accept
feel
If

take
look
tip
try

lessen
big
emotions
quickly
If
possible
wait

filled

I

And
I
NOT

My
memory
never

I
ever
particularly
quick
verbal
feet
I
wasn’t
adept
ad-libbing
spontaneous
This
spell
certain
doom
So
I
committed

The
day
approached
I
close
complete
mental
physical

fear
kept
chewing
away
absolutely
flawless
delivery
I
arrived

filled
drop
excitement
drowned
leaden
sea

I
met

told
casually
settle
relax
it’s
going
great
cute
little
pat
back
said
“Oh
way

closing

No

They
chuckled
I
gasped
sputtered
turned

tried
throw
feet
“You’ll
great”
assured
I
went
back

room
doubled
terror
I
tried

nod
distractedly

moan
They
smiled
politely
moved
away
I
paced
around
back

shaking
wringing
hands
alternating
back
forth
sweating
shivering
I
went
walk
around
building
muttering
virtues
food
trucks
rather
practicing
lines
I
attempted
manner
breathing
exercise
meditation
technique
Nothing
seemed
help
except
surrendering
extreme
bodily
discomfort
I
even
got
bodywork
done
back
stage
I
head
I
bail
claim
sudden

politely

The
day
crept
agonizingly
slow
closer
closer
twelve
titanic
minutes
shame
disgrace
I
hard
time
listening
let
alone
appreciating
speakers
And
I
suddenly
wired
introduced
I
practically
ran
stage
much
excited
bewildered
motion
pushed
traffic
If
I
ran
cars
maybe
swerve
around
But
couple
steps
I
muster
limp
jog
The
cars
revved
engines
sped
toward
headlights
shiny
grills
stared
eagerly
waiting
regale
profound
insight
wisdom
beauty
voice
startling
authority
warmth
I
started
talking
let
words
fall
mouth
like
small
pieces
broken
glass
I
half-expecting
begin
shrill
high-pitched
squeak
least
voice
crack
shutter
But
instead
terror-fueled
mechanical
propulsion
coming
distant
planet
The
words
marched
mouth
commanded
I
following
along
nicely
keeping
edgy
pace
even
losing
thoughts
Maybe
I’m
roll
I
thought
sharp
blooms

Until
minutes
40
seconds
I
revving
big
epiphany
denouement
irresistible
“call
action”
—I
going
get
TED
ovation
dammit
But
instead
I
blanked
I
stumbled
one
lines
lost
track
went
mute
There
mostly
nothing
except
tangled
pile
broken
sentences
far
foggy
distance
That
course
blaring
silence
baring
intensity
I
jump
way
avoid
crushed
death
After
far
many
split
seconds
lights
burning
hole
scalp
drowning
agonizing
silence
I
shrug
shoulders
say
“I
guess
that’s
it.”
I
ran

tail
clenched
tight

whole

vibrating

devastating

lazy
puff

In

Luther
When
I
younger
early
twenties
I
often
lazy
Too
often
actually
And
I
didn’t
Get
school
work
done
good
way
cram
stress
days
exam
Work
cook
healthy
food
felt
hard
I
gained
30+
pounds
weight
fitness
levels
went
Take
care
personal
growth
dreams
mostly
let
slide
“someday”
things
remained
daydreams
10+
years
later
I
still
love
lazying
around
much
But
I’ve
also
learned
keep
lazy
time
moderate
healthy
amount
instead
letting
hold
back
stuck
place
excuses
years
like
used
This
week
I’d
like
share
simple
habits
helped
make
change
To
stop
lazy
get
really
matters
done
working
smarter
While
still
room
guilt-free
lazy
time
spend
I
like
Be
kind
When
feel
you’ve
perhaps
lazy
lately
it’s
common
tempting
beat
hope
lead
start
taking
action
Sometimes
But
I
found
beating
often
leads
feeling
guiltier
like
failure
And
feel
less
motivated
get
going
procrastinate
seems
little
point
even
trying
Instead
getting
stuck
self-esteem
sucking
place
I
recommend
gently
nudge
towards
next
tip
article
whenever
feel
like
want
beat
Start
small
step
forward
The
hardest
thing
often
simply
get
started
So
make
easy
reduce
inner
resistance
actually
take
action
Start
taking
small
step
forward
Go
running
minutes
Do
dishes
minutes
Write
report
you’ve
procrastinating
minutes
I
use
habit
almost
every
day
way
I’m
example
creating
new
course
daily
aim
past
months
usually
write
page
day
And
writing
done
aim
I
start
day
often
edit
page
That’s
But
never
stopped
page
months
I
written
edited
whole
bunch
day
Do
small
part
matters
first
thing
day
To
feel
like
enjoy
lazy/rest
time
fully
without
guilt
it’s
important
actually
get
truly
matters
long
run
done
week
So
start
day
But
make
easy
breaking
task
smaller
steps
focus
first
one
Get
right
away
get
effective
focused
mindset
By
set
good
tone
day
You
get
quick
5-10
minute
win
first
thing
you’ll
lot
motivated
keep
going
path
rest
day
Instead
starting
busy
work
like
checking
emails
–
may
vital
first
thing
many
it’s
probably
–
checking
Facebook
etc
30
minutes
later
getting
started
today’s
work
Cycle
fully
focused
work
small
breaks
rest/lazy
time
To
lighten
daily
work
inject
small
breaks
short
focused
burst
work
Say
I’ll
20
minutes
work
task
I
take
minutes
lazy
time
By
breaking
hours
like
work
seems
less
daunting
And
you’ll
feel
energetic
motivated
longer
work
better
quality
allow
pauses
rest
time
lazy
around
Facebook
game
relaxing
grass
short
walk
park
Then
time
may
want
work
40
minutes
take
minute
break
But
go
easy
first
And
trouble
sticking
time-limits
use
app
phone
simple
egg-timer
kitchen
Shut
escape
routes
temporarily
Just
sitting
example
computer
trying
fully
focused
work
20
minutes
may
result
work
importance
getting
done
Not
don’t
remove
things
usually
use
procrastinate
So
ask
I
usually
escape
instead
work
For
it’s
example
often
smart
phone
checking
Reddit
Twitter
random
internet
browsing
So
I
put

But

How

Then
talk
things

Let

Whatever

If

So

Truly

Time

makes

But
I

It
Starts

Creates
stress
instead
relaxing
I’m
getting
what’s
important
done
negative
consequences
quite
soon
Still
moderate
amount
spending
time
lazy
truly
beneficial
And
I’ve
found
think
little

spend
lazy
time
–
matter
it’s

–
use

something
really

like
reading

brings
happiness
fulfillment
I’ve
also
learned
I
spend

I’m

So
I
make

Nine
one

types
Enneagram
“wheel

many
admirable
strengths
qualities
A
Nine
referred
“The
Peacemaker”
“The
Mediator.”
Who
wouldn’t
want
Nine
But
hearing

Nine
made
want

How

I
learned
We
Nine’s

As
participant
several
classes
throughout
past
year
I
discovered
many
paradoxes
type
We’re
mediators
see
everyone’s
point
view
hate
conflict
kind
often
deny
anger
We’re
peaceful
passive-aggressive
We’re
calm
unwilling
step
claim

And
we’re
good
seeing

become

Good

I
often
recall
moment

I
packed
suitcases
said
goodbye

new

It

I
spending

I

I

I

Of

Suddenly

Winners

Life

90’s
Back
I

That
Today
many

use
browse

work

We
spend

So
many
potential

seem
made
people
stressed
overwhelmed
past
Working

isn’t

So

I’d
like
share
habits
help
keep
attention
truly
matters
–
work
private
life
–
time
minimize
stress
overwhelm
Shut
notifications
To
find
focus
first
simple
thing
shut
notifications
Your

Social

apps
Then
get
back
truly
matters
without

hanging
distracting
Keep
smart

far
away
quality
time/work
The
simplest
way
distracted
time
smartphone
put
small
obstacles
don’t
easy
tempting
access
Here’s
instance
I
I
work
I
put

quality
time
time

Unplug
use

keep

When
I
write

I
usually
disconnected

If
that’s
possible
try
browser
addon
like
example
StayFocusd
temporarily
block

know
tend
procrastinate
waste
much
time
Check
email

day
Make
conscious
choice
handle

Instead
anytime
feel
bored
overwhelmed
stressed
Or
simply
stuck
habit
10-20
times

I
go
things
one
around

afternoon
Then
I’m

I
spent
several
hours

requires
focus
energy
If
feel
urge
check
something
set
time
pause
Sit
stand
still
minute
The
impulse
pass
get
back
Instead
getting
track
end
distracted
15-30
minutes

Stop
comparing
life
someone’s
high-light
reel
When
start
comparing
life
old
classmates
friends
celebrities
share
Instagram
Facebook

see
perfect
wonderful
homes
kids
work
lives
create
lot
stress
erode
self-esteem
So
get
stuck

Remember
share
usually
high-light

lives
positive
moments
The
stuff
part
life
happens
don’t
see
Focus
comparing
instead
See
far
come

I

When

discovered

giving
fired

realized

I
thought

I’ll
honest
–
showering
getting
ready
gym
often
SoulCycle
locker
room
kinda
sorta
I
turn
bit
diva
I’ve
gotten
used
creature
comforts
getting
ready
home
I
dread
elsewhere
But
obviously
life
happens
I
want
squeeze
workout
busy
day
sometimes
getting
ready
gym
going
right
next
destination
best
bet
So
tips
tricks
I’ve
learned
years
make
getting
ready
gym
quicker
easier
Dry
shampoo
No
surprise
Depending
sweaty
I
got
workout
sexy
I
know
I
sometimes
skip
washing
hair
generous
sprinkle/spray
dry
shampoo
trick
Use
wet
cold
possible
towel
face
neck
One
things
I
hate
getting
ready
directly
working
I
don’t
much
time
I’d
like
let
body
cool
Ideally
I
like
ice
face
help
cool
relieve
puffiness
cold
towel
help
trick
Travel-size
everything
You
get
anything
travel
size
–

iron
straightener
toiletries
etc
If
you’re
regularly
getting
ready
gym
less
carry

make
process
less
pain
Roll
clothes
instead

This
tip

packing
general

avoid
wrinkling
It
Also
saves
space
gym
bag
Use
backpack
I
know
I
know
backpacks
aren’t
exactly
glamorous
accessory
But
you’re
going
walking
lot
gym/work
stuff
it’s
much
manageable
carrying
everything
shoulder
bag
If
car
don’t
need
carry
much
stuff
–
disregard
I
envy
6
master
top
knot
Sometimes
despite
best
efforts

Stress
It’s
one
sneaky
things
actually
rule
entire
life
without
even
fully
realizing
If
I’m
honest
stress
forefront
life
longer
I’d
care
admit
As
someone
lives
New
York
City
easygoing
city
world
self-employed
adult
life
exactly
“safest”
gig
–
I
don’t
really
cards
playing
favor
comes
living
stress-free
life
And
I’ve
kind
given
excuse
living
stress
without
thinking
anything
I
But
here’s
thing
I’ve
learning
stress
–
actually
little
circumstances
much
mindset/attitude
After
recent
resurgence
stress
life
I
I’d
like
call
“oh
HELL
no”
moment
I
decided
I
don’t
want
live
way
anymore
Living
fog
stress
I
want
rest
adult
life
–
let’s
honest
–
isn’t
going
get
easier
I
decided
instead
succumbing
stress
“normal”
part
life
–
I
going
fight
everything
I’ve
got
So
things
helped
exponentially
become
free
stress
I
think
help
How
I
Broke
Up
With
Stress
Pray
deliverance
This
absolutely
first
important
step
becoming
free
grips
stress
God
makes
clear
worry
Matthew
6
seek
pursue
peace
Psalm
34:14
I
fully
believe
He
deliver
fully
stress
fear
anxiety
Oftentimes
it’s
matter
asking
Him
Face
issue
actually
happens
For
main
trigger
stress
worrying
something
actually
even
happened
Oftentimes
dwell
made
scenarios
–
matter
likely
unlikely
may
–
become
reality
minds
This
definitely
constant
mind
shift
take
place
I’ve
started
make
habit
telling
“if/when
scenario
ever
happens
you’re
allowed
concerned
But
then…it’s
even
reality.”
Because
here’s
thing
–
time
dealing
ACTUAL
situation
happens
much
manageable
painful
make
minds
So
face
issue
comes
rather
let
paralyze
fear
stress
it’s
even
reality
Don’t
verbally
affirm
you’re
stressed
The
words
speak
lives
power
realize
Instead
coming
agreement
stress
speak
AGAINST
When
I
feel
stress
creeping
one
first
things
I
open
journal
write
things
I’m
thankful
The
power
gratitude
beats
grips
stress
every
time
Break
idea
stress
normal
The
lie
stress
“normal”
part
life
–
even
worse
means
we’re
RESPONSIBLE
–
one
biggest
easiest
lies
believe
Especially
someone
self-employed
I
constantly
find
feeling
like
I’m
working
hard
enough
I’m
completely
overwhelmed
stress
A
practical
thing
helped
tracking
daily
tasks
I
use
Toggl.com
I
look
back
end
day
see
I
fact
accomplish
lot
stress
doesn’t
part
equation
Take
one
day
time
Of
course
life
always
times
consider
future
But
much
try
finish
day
done
As
previously
mentioned
–
God
tells
worry
–
He
specifically
says
worry
tomorrow
Matthew
6:34
His
grace
sufficient
THIS
day
Unplug
technology
This
something
I
definitely
need
work
😉
It’s
still
struggle
I’d
love
get
point
I’m
phone/computer
hour
two
morning
going
bed
night
Repeat
things
every
Single
Day
Here’s
thing
tips/tools
–
work
constantly

Make
daily

FIGHT

Dear
Mom
Dad
Thank
Thank
driving
three
hours
visit
hospital
Thank
bringing
Christmas
little
room
third
floor
Thank
cooking
meals
weighing
morning
I
got
home
Thank
trusting
I
ready
go
back

Thank
biting
tongue
wanted
ask
I
sticking
meal

Thank
believing
For
crying
For
celebrating
small
victory
For
never
ever
giving
But
here’s
I
want
know
No
matter
hard
try
you’ve
never
stranglehold
eating
disorder
you’ll
never
understand
If
you’ve
never
lain
bed
planning
every
bite
food
pass
lips
next
day
you’ll
never
understand
If
hollow
feeling
inside
never
felt
like
accomplishment
you’ll
never
understand
If
whispering
voice
anorexia
never
increased
volume
think
nothing
else
you’ll
never
understand
If
you’ve
never
dreamed
going
sleep
waking
escape
you’ll
never
understand
And
it’s
okay
stop
trying
You
might
know
I
know
hard
tried
I’ve
seen
books
anorexia
shelf
evidence
read
every
single
one
get
hands
I
watched
barely
keep
together
family
therapy
saw
trying
stay
strong
wanted
fall
apart
I
saw
try
hide
pain
face
I
angrily
accused
putting
“nutritionist-required”
amount
butter
toast
I
know
much
hurt
see
child
sob
meal
much
stung
food
you’d
spent
hour
carefully
measuring
weighing
preparing
cold
time
entered
mouth
I
know
hard
tried
How
recovery
almost
exhausting
difficult
And
I
love
More
ever
know
And
although
would’ve
made
first
months
recovery
indescribably
easier
I’m
glad
didn’t
understand
It
means
you’ve
never
experienced
agony
comes
literally
watching
disappear
eyes
It
means
you’ve
never
experienced
crippling
desire
control
reality
sucking
life
bit
bit
I
waited
die
organs
shut
body
slowly
slipped
kind
hibernation
deluded
malnourished
brain
actually
believing
still
control
That
friends’
worries
unwarranted
That
uneasy
looks
professors’
faces
figment
imagination
expression
real
fear
I
going
stop
breathing
middle
class
I’m
happy
can’t
relate
I
know
sounds
cliché
I
promise
I
mean
bottom
heart
My
heart
keeps
strong
steady
beat
pumping
blood
healthy
body
I’ve
waited
long
able
say
And
it’s
largely
thanks
support
love
I
say
It’s
constant
reminders
strength
talk
simply
picking
phone
instead
visiting
cemetery
And
I’m
eating
disorder
survivor
that’s
I
You
reminded
along
way
While
others
treated
like
I
fragile
like
eating
disorders
contagious
kept
eyes
fixed
girl
I
And
walked
often
one
step
forward
two
steps
back
I
girl
Remembering
I
I
got
sick
difficult
incredibly
important
part
recovery
And
time
I
got
little
piece
back
I
thought
You
made
I
I
believed
–
still
do–
victory
I
wrestled
even
miniscule
part
girl
back
disease
tried
best
kill
But
please
never
forget
don’t
understand
past
share
journey
Let’s
look
forward
together
I’m
planning
future
full
laughter
joy
knock-your-socks-off
accomplishments
And
